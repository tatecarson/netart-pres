      <notes
        >"Participation TV" was built by Nam June Paik in 1969. Two microphones
        control patterns on a television set. Paik says The Video Synthesizer
        was "actually somehow the beginning of the Internet...Because you were
        able to create media content for yourself, like you can do on the
        Internet now. It is very important to make media yourself. Now with the
        PC and the Internet we have a better chance of doing something." Paik
        also coined the term "information superhighway" which became used to
        describe the possibilities of the internet.

        >''Wrap Around the World,'' a 90-minute live television broadcast
        featuring performances and other events produced simultaneously from 10
        countries in Europe and Asia, was broadcast 9/10/1988. It was a
        State-of-the-art transmission with new video effects. This clip features
        David Bowie and Performance artists La La La Human Steps in a special
        rendition of his song "Look Back in Anger" with a special introduction
        by Al Franken and Dr. Mobius - an alien from another planet (Tom Davis).
        The whole event was held together by Nam June Paik's video graphics,
        which included one of his stacked television sculptures. Posted in
        recognition of the loss of one of the great performers of the last 40
        years spanning Glam Rock, Jazz, Blues, Rock-n-roll and Pop. He never did
        what was expected and always pushed the envelope. David Bowie died
        1/11/16 and will be missed.</notes

        Weil, äda 'web was a platform for online artworks, experimental
        literature, publishing, and even exhibitions. It functioned within an
        internet startup as a “digital foundry” that commissioned artists to
        work directly with web designers and developers to explore the internet
        as medium and distribution channel.</notes

        >Securityland and Wonderland are elaborate online projects Julia Scher
        has created with Ã¤da 'web, launched in 1995 and 1997, respectively;
        they were preceded by an introductory trailer titled Danger Dirty Data
        in 1995. Scher offers various areas for user exploration, many of which
        raise issues of control and personal privacy. All manner of
        psychologically and physically invasive services and products are
        seductively pitched at the visitor, promising to alleviate problems
        caused internally and externally. Loosely based on architectural and
        clinical models, Securityland and Wonderland completely destabilize the
        notion of neutral or straightforward interchange, using inflections that
        are libidinal, gendered, quasi-institutional and subtly threatening.

        an exhibition in an art gallery. The work was related to Davis's
        exhibition also being shown called InterActions (1967-1981). Davis says
        he wanted to focus on the keyboard as a means of interaction that
        differentiated it from other media such as the TV. About it he says:
        "This means a lot more intense and personal link could occur between me
