        >"Participation TV" was built by Nam June Paik in 1969. Two microphones
        control patterns on a television set. Paik says The Video Synthesizer
        was "actually somehow the beginning of the Internet...Because you were
        able to create media content for yourself, like you can do on the
        Internet now. It is very important to make media yourself. Now with the
        PC and the Internet we have a better chance of doing something." Paik
        also coined the term "information superhighway" which became used to
        describe the possibilities of the internet.

        >''Wrap Around the World,'' a 90-minute live television broadcast
        featuring performances and other events produced simultaneously from 10
        countries in Europe and Asia, was broadcast 9/10/1988. It was a
        State-of-the-art transmission with new video effects. This clip features
        David Bowie and Performance artists La La La Human Steps in a special
        rendition of his song "Look Back in Anger" with a special introduction
        by Al Franken and Dr. Mobius - an alien from another planet (Tom Davis).
        The whole event was held together by Nam June Paik's video graphics,
        which included one of his stacked television sculptures. Posted in
        recognition of the loss of one of the great performers of the last 40
        years spanning Glam Rock, Jazz, Blues, Rock-n-roll and Pop. He never did
        what was expected and always pushed the envelope. David Bowie died
        1/11/16 and will be missed.</notes

        they were preceded by an introductory trailer titled Danger Dirty Data
        in 1995. Scher offers various areas for user exploration, many of which
        raise issues of control and personal privacy. All manner of
        psychologically and physically invasive services and products are
        seductively pitched at the visitor, promising to alleviate problems
        caused internally and externally. Loosely based on architectural and
        clinical models, Securityland and Wonderland completely destabilize the
        notion of neutral or straightforward interchange, using inflections that
        are libidinal, gendered, quasi-institutional and subtly threatening.

        exhibition also being shown called InterActions (1967-1981). Davis says
        he wanted to focus on the keyboard as a means of interaction that
        differentiated it from other media such as the TV. About it he says:
        "This means a lot more intense and personal link could occur between me

        “The pieces on www.re-move.org are an attempt to articulate mathematical
        and natural principles below a visual surface in an enjoyable and
        sometimes playful way. People should be able to get their own ideas
        about the pieces and involve themselves without having any preconception
        of how to watch or how to “use” the pieces – that’s why there are no
        instructions or any guidelines. Depending of the used formulas and also
        depending on who is watching/playing around, the results of the created
        images and/or sounds will always be different – in that sense, the user
        can also be seen as an additional random-factor in the code which can
        help to create a more or less “organic” result.”</notes

        computer programs, and video and computer games. Radically disrupting
        the very language of these systems, including interfaces, commands,
        errors and code, JODI stages extreme digital interventions that
        destabilize the relationship between computer technology and its users.

        >I’m an early adopter of the web and developed my first web-based
        applications for financial data in 1996 while working for a market data
        startup called LPC. For much of my career I’ve worked in a
        designer/architect role – information architect and user experience –
        but my background in programming (Java/SQL, Javascript, C++, C) gives me
        insight into the inner workings of software systems. After LPC was sold
        to Reuters in the late ’90s I made a name for myself as a new-media
        artist and am considered to be a pioneer of digital art on the Internet.
        More recently, after several years in the big corporation experience at
        Thomson Reuters, I am back in startups, consulting for a new personal

        'see' the web. It filters and organizes a huge mass of structured
        information that spans continents, is constantly growing, reorganizing
        itself, shifting its appearance, evolving. The Shredder presents this
        global structure as a chaotic, irrational, raucous "action painting". By
        altering the HTML code before the browser reads it, the Shredder
        appropriates the data of the web, transforming it into a parallel web.
        Content become abstraction. Text becomes graphics. Information becomes

        separate domains into one browser window.

        >2020 - The ability to understand and share other people’s feelings and
        problems is known as empathy. On the web page empathi.cc, artist Raphaël
        Bastide created a graphic element which can be moved and can mimic
        visual attributes from its neighbours. The style transfer between the
        page’s elements can be considered as a minimal version of empathy, where
        the distance between objects triggers visual mutations. Consequently,
        the main graphic element gets affected by an accumulating memory of
        style properties depending on its path.
