      Participatory mobile music with smartphones
      <notes
        >in this presentation i'll be discussing four of my most recent
        smartphone works from a research and artistic perspective. I'll talk
        about each work individually but also the themes that tie them together.
        And finally i'll discuss my plans future work and for involving students
        in this research while at College of Charleston.</notes

        How can we use smartphones in a collective way to bring people together
        to make art and music? How can we use smartphones to encourage awareness
        of nature?
        <hr />
        using the smartphone as an instrument allows for the breakdown between
        audience and performer.

        A more perfect union (2017)
        <a href="https://ampu.site/" target="blank">https://ampu.site</a>
      </div>

      <notes
        >A more perfect union is an experiment in participatory real-time
        composing, where the audience chooses the outcome of the work by
        evaluating the sounds they hear. The longer a person listens to a melody
        the more likely an aspect of that melody persist in future generations.
        The work is based on an evolutionary algorithm, in which the fittest
        sound of a group passes on its genes, combines with another fit sound,
        and creates a new one with the best of both. The piece ends when an
        emergent sound is found that should hopefully satisfy the
        audience.</notes

        >This piece is a sequencer made of distributed smartphones. The idea is
        to allow a group of people in a relaxed situation to make a piece of
        ambient music with their smartphones. I derive all the interactions with
        the music from the orientation of the phones. The player makes one
        motion, and it changes the piece then listens to the result. There is
        not meant to be constant user interaction, more tuning the way you would
        a stereo.</notes

      <notes
        >Sounds Aware is a web application that runs on a smartphone and uses
        machine learning to detect human-made sound (anthrophony) and masks it
        with ambient music as a user walks around their environment. Though the
        model is pre-trained with the author’s local environmental sounds, the
        user can train the model further on their unique soundscape so that each
        user gets a personalized experience. After the training process, the
        user can listen to ambient music based on traits of the surrounding
        anthrophony. If the app senses less anthrophony and more biophony or
        geophony, then the music fades away, bringing the user’s attention to
        the anthrophony.</notes

        <!-- TODO: get parts from the paper, they're more update -->
        immaterial.cloud is an immersive audiovisual installation that explores
        a possible networked future of peer-to-peer technologies, away from the
        cloud. Participants experience the work via two to four smartphones
        placed in different locations in a room. As participants walk up to a
        phone, they see a representation of themselves through data. If the
        participant gets close enough, the phone triggers a change in the sound
        of immaterial.cloud and the other phones follow.

      <notes>
        immaterial.cloud creates the opportunity for a shared space with
        participants by using technology in a collective way. It requires the
        phones to act together, and out of their hands, not as individuals as is
        usual in this era of personalized devices. Experiencing immaterial.cloud
        presents an opportunity for a restoration of attention that might have
        been lost by an overuse of technology in the typical way.

        >''Wrap Around the World,'' a 90-minute live television broadcast
        featuring performances and other events produced simultaneously from 10
        countries in Europe and Asia, was broadcast 9/10/1988. It was a
        State-of-the-art transmission with new video effects. This clip features
        David Bowie and Performance artists La La La Human Steps in a special
        rendition of his song "Look Back in Anger" with a special introduction
        by Al Franken and Dr. Mobius - an alien from another planet (Tom Davis).
        The whole event was held together by Nam June Paik's video graphics,
        which included one of his stacked television sculptures. Posted in
        recognition of the loss of one of the great performers of the last 40
        years spanning Glam Rock, Jazz, Blues, Rock-n-roll and Pop. He never did
        what was expected and always pushed the envelope. David Bowie died
        1/11/16 and will be missed.</notes
